	<p>Those of you who have had the opportunity to work with Alex know the qualities that make him so effective in business development. Craig Smith will be joining Worldgroup from CMG as our new Chief Information Officer. We have selected Suzanne after an extensive search to find a candidate who has the energy, passion and skills to lead our incredibly talented group of strategic executives.</p>
	<p>We have made impressive showings at all of the global, regional and local awards shows this year. In addition to his role in improving our strategic expertise and capabilities overall, he has provided critical strategic leadership on many of our global accounts. Many of our long-term clients, such as General Motors, General Mills, MasterCard, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and L'Oréal, have remained our partners for this exact reason.</p>
	<p>Please join me in congratulating Alex on his new role. I am very pleased to announce that Suzanne Powers will join us as our new Global Chief Strategy Officer. We are very excited about this.</p>
	<p>I am pleased to announce that Daryl Lee has been promoted to Global CEO of UM, McCann Worldgroup's global media agency partner. I want everyone to know how proud I am of the work you are doing. And, as you have seen in my notes about creative awards, our outstanding work rightly is being saluted by the industry.</p>
	<p>As we begin the New Year I want to share with you several changes to our management. Less than 10 agency creatives are recognized and the fact that both Linus and John are included is a testament to the incredible work they have been doing for us. Bill will work closely and collaboratively with the Commonwealth leadership team of Linus Karlsson, Joe Garcia,Kate MacNevin and Matt Woehrmann.</p>
