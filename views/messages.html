	<p>I want everyone to know how proud I am of the work you are doing. London also won a Yellow Pencil for the 'Games Maker' campaign for the London Olympics and The Martin Agency won a Yellow Pencil for the 'Clouds Over Cuba' campaign for The JFK Presidential Library & Museum. Please join me in welcoming Rob and congratulating Linus and Andreas on their new roles.</p>
	<p>The impact of your smart thinking and creativity is being reflected in our continued growth and business success, including the addition of several new assignments from our global clients as well as wins of new regional and local clients. His collaborative, energetic and insightful leadership style is one of the biggest reasons why he, and MRM, have been so successful. In addition to his tenacity, he relishes the complexity of brand challenges.</p>
	<p>North America continues to win significant new business across a broad spectrum of clients. Tara Comonte will be departing as Chief Financial Officer. A highly-awarded creative, Rob's work has been recognized at Cannes with multiple Titanium and Grand Prix Lions as well as three Interactive Agency of the Year awards.</p>
	<p>Over the last few weeks, I've traveled to Asia and the Middle East, meeting with clients and our key leadership. 2013 has been a fantastic year for our clients' businesses and for our creative reputation. Craig Smith will be joining Worldgroup from CMG as our new Chief Information Officer.</p>
	<p>He also knows how to work with leadership to harness our global resources and find new ways to deliver our multiplatform capabilities. Bill will work closely and collaboratively with the Commonwealth leadership team of Linus Karlsson, Joe Garcia,Kate MacNevin and Matt Woehrmann. In addition, Linus Karlsson has been promoted to Creative Chairman of Commonwealth, and Andreas Dahlqvist has been promoted to Chief Creative Officer of Commonwealth and also named President of the McCann Creative Leadership Council.</p>
	<p>Linus, in addition to his responsibilities for Commonwealth and Chevy, will be starting a new venture in the spring. We have also won a significant amount of new business and have been awarded organic business opportunities from our existing clients. In addition, Linus Karlsson has been promoted to Creative Chairman of Commonwealth, and Andreas Dahlqvist has been promoted to Chief Creative Officer of Commonwealth and also named President of the McCann Creative Leadership Council.</p>
	<p>He was named President of the Americas, Middle East and Africa for McCann Worldgroup in late 2012 and is one of the world's most respected global leaders, having directly overseen multinational clients and McCann operations in Latin America, North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. He understands how to navigate today's attention-challenged, media-fragmented consumer world using creativity that has the sharpest strategic intent across any and all platforms, cultures, and geographies. Finally, I want to thank all of you for what we've accomplished in 2013.</p>
	<p>We just received some terrific news. Before coming over to McCann in mid-2010, Daryl was President of Global Strategy at UM, which is a division of IPG Mediabrands. We have made impressive showings at all of the global, regional and local awards shows this year.</p>
